      <p>The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway in 1970. </p>
      <p> The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. In this version the initial state is randomly determined on load. Each cell has a 50% chance of being either "alive" or "dead".</p>
      <p> This implementation is built completely in JavaScript. Check out the code <a href="http://github.com/trostli/Game_of_Life_JS">here!</a></p>

      <h2>Rules:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
      </ol>
